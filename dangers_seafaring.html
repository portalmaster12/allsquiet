        The poster portrays overseas travel as a trivial endeavor. It’s just a little jump across the
      channel. However the reality is much different. Despite the relative incapacitation of the German
      High Seas Fleet by the British Royal Navy at the beginning of WWI, the development of a new
       technology by the German Navy, the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23861/23861-h/23861-h.htm"> U-Boat</a>
       , proved to be a new danger on the seas. Able to operate for weeks without docking, and slip unnoticed under the water, it allowed submarines to
      operate effectively without Naval supremacy. In 1915 the German Army declared Unrestricted
      Submarine Warfare, however, after proving to be ineffective and diplomatically costly, they shut
      the system down until 1917 when the war was getting desperate. With a renewed submarine
      fleet, the probability of surviving a roundtrip trip from Britain to an area beyond Gibraltar was an
      estimated 3 in 4 chance. Though the main threat of U-Boats was in the Atlantic, there were instances
      where German U-Boats slipped across enemy minefields and <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/1915/08/23/archives/lapland-is-safe-three-ships-sunk-five-lives-lost-when-british.html'> attacked ships in the English
      Channel</a>.

        The threat of u-boats was so prevalent that many ships employed “dazzle camouflage.”
         <br>
        The intention of the camouflage was to make it difficult to estimate a ship's location, orientation, and trajectory.
