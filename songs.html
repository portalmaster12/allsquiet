    Johnnie, get your gun<br>
Get your gun, get your gun<br>
Take it on the run<br>
On the run, on the run<br>
Hear them calling, you and me<br>
Every son of liberty<br>
Hurry right away<br>
No delay, go today<br>
Make your daddy glad<br>
To have had such a lad<br>
Tell your sweetheart not to pine<br>
To be proud her boy's in line<br>
Over there, over there<br>
Send the word, send the word over there<br>
That the Yanks are coming<br>
The Yanks are coming<br>
The drums rum-tumming<br>
Everywhere<br>
So prepare, say a prayer<br>
Send the word, send the word to beware<br>
We'll be over, we're coming over<br>
And we won't come back till it's over<br>
Over there<br>
Johnnie, get your gun<br>
Get your gun, get your gun<br>
Johnnie show the Hun<br>
Who's a son of a gun<br>
Hoist the flag and let her fly<br>
Yankee Doodle do or die<br>
Pack your little kit<br>
Show your grit, do your bit<br>
Yankee to…<br>

     Over There! is an example of a classic popular World War I song. It was more often sung by civilians and untried recruits who had not seen the front line yet. The grim humor and raw emotions of trenches created a more realistic and darker breed of music known as “Trench Songs”, where men took the jaunty, uplifting popular tunes, and set them to dark, graphic lyrics. Below are lyrics and recordings of some of these songs.

          If you want to find the lance-jack, I know where he is<br>
I know where he is, I know where he is<br>
If you want to find the lance-jack, I know where he is<br>
He's scrounging round the cookhouse door.<br>
I've seen him, I've seen him<br>
Scrounging round the cookhouse door, I've seen him,<br>
Scrounging round the cookhouse door.<br>
The company sergeant...He's laying on the latrine floor<br>
The quarter master...Miles and miles behind the lines.<br>
The sergeant-major...Thieving all the squaddies' rum.<br>
The buckshee private...Buried in a deep shell hole.<br>
The C.O....Down in a deep dugout.<br>
The brasshats...Drinking claret at Brigade HQ.<br>
The politicians....Drinking brandy at the House of Commons bar.<br>
The whole battalion...Hanging on the old barbed wire.

          I want to go home, I want to go home.<br>
I don't want to go in the trenches no more,<br>
Where whizzbangs and shrapnel they whistle and roar.<br>
Take me over the see, where the Alleyman can't get at me.<br>
Oh my, I don't want to die, I want to go home.<br>
I want to go home, I want to go home.<br>
I don't want to visit la Belle France no more,<br>
For oh the Jack Johnsons they make such a roar.<br>
Take me over the sea, where the snipers they can't get at me.<br>
Oh my, I don't want to die, I want to go home.
