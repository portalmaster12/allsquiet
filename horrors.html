      “The enemy as they run cannot do much before they are within 40 yards . . . they have already suffered heavily when they reach the barbed wire entanglements, a whole line has gone down before our machine guns.” From All Quiet on the Western Front, p. 112. Photograph from Getty Images.

<p>This poster assumes that, first of all, one would actually survive the war and return home to a family. In reality, 19 million deaths and 23 million wounded military personnel made WWI rank among the deadliest conflicts in human history.
Secondly, the poster assumes that a father would actually tell his child what he did in the war. World War I was horrific and dehumanizing and most of the men who returned seldom spoke of it.

  All Quiet on the Western Front</a>, the author, Erich Maria Remarque, who was a veteran of World War I, accurately portrays the experiences of a German soldier in the war. At one point, the main character, Paul Bäumer, describes the intense guilt and remorse he feels when he has to lay next to a man he stabbed, who lies dying for an entire day.
“This dying man has time with him, he has an invisible dagger with which he stabs me. . . No doubt his wife still thinks of him; she does not know what happened. He looks as if he would have often written to her.” (221)
The men in the war had to kill other human beings. They stabbed them with knives, shot them with machine guns, blew them to pieces with shells and tanks. New recruits were unable to deal with these dangers and they died by the thosands, Paul notes that “Their sharp downy dead faces, have the awful expressionlessness of dead children.” (130)

The blood and gore, the reality of death, the sounds of agony heard almost non-stop  took a toll on the soldiers and Paul says: “We have become wild beasts. We do not fight, we defend ourselves against annihilation.” (113)

None of this is something a man would tell his five year old daughter.
